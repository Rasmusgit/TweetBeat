## What is TweetBeat? 
A website where you can enter any twitter username (@realDonaldTrump) or any hashtag (#tacotuesday) and get an audio representation of the emotional state in that feed.

## Why?
Understanding the emotional state of an area of society through Twitter can be useful for many things:
* On the US Presidential election day 2016, 40 million tweets was produced in 24 hours
* During the 2014 FIFA World Cup Final, 618,725 tweets were sent in a single minute
* Perhaps a sonification of these events will provide new and insightful data? 

## Sonification
* The use of non-speech audio to convey or perceptualize data
  * The Geiger Counter
* Our auditory perception has advantages in temporal, spatial, amplitude and frequency resolution 
  * Can be used instead of, or complimentary to data visualization
  
## How?

## The Sonification
**Reverb = Number of retweets a tweet has** 

**Volume = Number of followers a person has**

## Temporal aspects of the sonification
* The sound is played chronologically, based on the timestamp of the tweets.
* If there is a long pause, and no sound is produced, the software will scale down the pause.
* Pros and cons
 * Makes the data less ”realistic”?
 * Long pauses may cause listeners to think it’s finished or broken.
